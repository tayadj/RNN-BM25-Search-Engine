# RNN-BM25-Search-Engine

Advanced search engine that leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the BM25 relevance metric to provide highly accurate and relevant search results.

## Features

- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Utilizes RNN for processing and understanding the context of articles.
- **Neural Network Scaling**: Supports scaling of the neural network to improve performance and accuracy.
- **BM25 Relevance Metric**: Implements the BM25 algorithm to rank articles based on their relevance to the search query.
- **Automatic Topic Expansion**: Supports automatic expansion of article topics to enhance search results.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and provide quick search responses.
