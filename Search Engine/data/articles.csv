Obesity Around the World Continues to Rise,"A new medical report has found out that the number of obese people around the world has increased by 600% over the past 40 years. The report says that about 12% of the world's population suffers from obesity. Within the next decade 20% of the world's population will be overweight. The report is based on the body mass index (BMI), the relationship between height and weight. A normal, healthy person has a BMI of between 20 and 25. People with a BMI of over 30 are considered to be obese. It is no surprise that most of the world's obese people live in the wealthy countries of the world. US, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand account for a fifth of the world's obese people. China and the United States have the highest number of obese in the world. In contrast, the poorest countries have the lowest number of overweight people. In southern Asia and southeastern Asia, for example, 25% of the population are underweight. Having too many overweight people puts an enormous financial burden on our health system, through rising costs for medication, doctors and hospitals. Medical experts point out that obesity cannot be treated with medication and exercise alone. It is also important to change your diet and consume less fatty food and sugary drinks. We also need to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and reduce the intake of processed food.",Health
